## About Me

Hello! I'm **Zakaria**, a web development enthusiast with a passion for creating and deploying websites.

I've been testing and exploring GitHub Pages as a platform to build and deploy static websites directly from GitHub repositories. The seamless integration between code management and web hosting has been a game-changer for my projects.

Through this blog, I'll share my experiences, challenges, and solutions I've found while working with web technologies and GitHub's ecosystem.

### Getting Started with GitHub Pages
*April 12, 2025*

Today I want to share my experience setting up GitHub Pages for the first time. GitHub Pages is an amazing feature that allows you to host websites directly from your GitHub repositories.

The process is surprisingly simple: create a repository, add your HTML/CSS/JS or Markdown files, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. Within minutes, your site is live at username.github.io/repository-name!

### Customizing Your GitHub Pages Site
*April 5, 2025*

In this post, I'll walk through how I set up a custom domain and applied a theme to give my site a unique look and feel.

### Version Control for Web Development
*March 28, 2025*

One of the biggest advantages of using GitHub Pages is the built-in version control. Every change to your website is tracked, making it easy to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

I'll share my workflow for making changes, testing them locally, and pushing updates to the live site.

&copy; 2025 Zakaria. Built with GitHub Pages.



This Markdown file includes:

1. An "About Me" section highlighting you (Zakaria) and your experience with GitHub Pages
2. A blog section with sample posts about GitHub Pages
3. Projects and contact sections
4. Proper Markdown formatting with headers, emphasis, links, and separators

To use this on your GitHub Pages site:

1. Replace your current `index.md` file with this content
2. Commit and push the changes to your repository
3. GitHub Pages will automatically render this Markdown into a formatted webpage

If you're using a Jekyll theme, this Markdown will work with most themes automatically. You can also customize the content further by:

- Adding more details to your About Me section
- Creating actual blog posts (in separate .md files) and linking to them
- Adding images with the syntax `![alt text](image-url)`
- Applying a Jekyll theme through your _config.yml file

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this Markdown content?
